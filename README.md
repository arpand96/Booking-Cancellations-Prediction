**Business Problem:**

The INN Hotels group in Portugal faces a significant challenge with a high number of booking cancellations, resulting in various negative impacts. 
These cancellations lead to revenue losses as rooms cannot be resold, increased distribution costs through commissions and advertising, and reduced profit margins due to last-minute price reductions.
 Additionally, human resources are required to manage guest arrangements. The emergence of online booking channels has further complicated the issue, as cancellations are no longer limited to traditional booking patterns. 
To mitigate these losses and optimize operations, a data-driven solution is needed to predict cancellations, allowing the formulation of profitable policies for managing cancellations and refunds.

**Solution Approach:**

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Data Overview, Univariate & Bi-Variate Analysis.
2. Data Cleaning: Outlier Check and Treatment, Missing/Duplicate Value Check, Feature Engineering.
3. Logistic Regression: Thresholds, ROC/Precision-Recall Curves, Performance Optimization, Coefficients  Interpretation.
4. Decision Tree: Performance Criteria, Pre-Pruning, Post-Pruning, Final Model Selection & Evaluation.
5. Final Model Selection: Compare Logistic Regression Metrics with Decision Tree Metrics.
6. Business Recommendations: Actionable Insights, Profitable Suggestions.

**Concepts:** Logistic Regression Modelling, Decision Tree Classification, Data Modelling, Data Pre-Processing, Feauture Engineering, EDA

**Tools:** Python, Excel, JupyterNotebook
