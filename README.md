# Booking-Cancellations-Prediction
Utilizing Logistic Regression Modelling and Decision Trees for Predicting Booking Cancellations


Executive Summary:

The INN Hotels group in Portugal faces challenges with high booking cancellations, leading to revenue losses, increased costs, and reduced profit margins. 
To address this, a data-driven solution was implemented, utilizing exploratory data analysis, outlier treatment, feature engineering, logistic regression modeling, and decision trees. 
The solution focused on predicting cancellations to formulate profitable policies for managing cancellations and refunds. By analyzing patterns and factors contributing to cancellations, the solution provided insights to prioritize bookings, target non-special requests, and leverage online market segments. 
These recommendations aimed to optimize operations, minimize revenue losses, and enhance profitability for the INN Hotels group.

Business Problem:

The INN Hotels group in Portugal faces a significant challenge with a high number of booking cancellations, resulting in various negative impacts. 
These cancellations lead to revenue losses as rooms cannot be resold, increased distribution costs through commissions and advertising, and reduced profit margins due to last-minute price reductions.
 Additionally, human resources are required to manage guest arrangements. The emergence of online booking channels has further complicated the issue, as cancellations are no longer limited to traditional booking patterns. 
To mitigate these losses and optimize operations, a data-driven solution is needed to predict cancellations, allowing the formulation of profitable policies for managing cancellations and refunds.

Solution Approach:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Data Overview, Univariate & Bi-Variate Analysis.
2. Data Cleaning: Outlier Check and Treatment, Missing/Duplicate Value Check, Feature Engineering.
3. Logistic Regression: Thresholds, ROC/Precision-Recall Curves, Performance Optimization, Coefficients  Interpretation.
4. Decision Tree: Performance Criteria, Pre-Pruning, Post-Pruning, Final Model Selection & Evaluation.
5. Final Model Selection: Compare Logistic Regression Metrics with Decision Tree Metrics.
6. Business Recommendations: Actionable Insights, Profitable Suggestions.
